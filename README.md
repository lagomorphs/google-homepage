Introduction:

This is a project where I will be recreating the Google.com homepage in HTML and CSS.


Conclusion:

This project, while simple, was very effective in familiarizing me with multiple HTML and CSS mechanics. For example, sectioning your HTML file with <div> and <span> tags, positioning separate elements ands <div>s around the page in CSS, and the importance of overiding the default styles applied to the page by your browser. The project was also a great tool for becoming familiar with commonly used CSS properties and the kinds of values they can have. For instance, the short hand "border" property and its syntax as well as "text-decoration" (very useful for getting rid of underlined links!). All in all, it was a very successful learning project and I look forward to the next one.
